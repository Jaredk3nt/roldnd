# A City Beneath the Earth
> A ROL campaign based on the "evil" side of alignments

### Premise
You are a band of pirates / mercenaries / other scummy people that cross paths in a bar called Aurora's Nest on a station in the Badar system. Through any number of channels the crew learns about a possible hidden treasure in a system near by relating to an old myth...

It is said that these Voe'er were a group of dissidents to the creation of a unified republic of species. They called themselves the Saon'ir meaning the "Group of One". As the legislation went through to solidify the creation of the R.O.L the Saon'er left their home world to create a "pure" society of Voe'er. Their society was completely isolated from the rest of *the sphere* so little is known about it, but it was believed that they went to the Yiol system and formed their society there. However the only habitable planet in the system is known for its highly oxygenated atmosphere that allowed for the evolution of large creatures, making many past attempts at settlement challenging. Thus it is believed that they managed to burrow under the earth and created a metropolis of Voe'er.

Along with the myth one of the quest givers will tell your party that a Rieandi merchant has formed a mining base on the planet in Yiol. The base is a town lifted on stilts above the trees. The company has been farming and mining resources out of the planet
