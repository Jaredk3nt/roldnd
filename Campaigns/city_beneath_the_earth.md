# A City Beneath the Earth

A level 1-5 campaign written for the Republic of Life homebrew for Dungeons & DragonsÂ® 5th edition.

## Background

Long ago, at the dawn of the republic, a group of around 1000 outcast Voe'er formed a colony on the lush moon of Riberus, orbiting a gas giant in the Yiol system near the edge of *The Sphere*. All among the group were dissenters of a republic, and in vying for Voe'er isolation they were banished from their home world No'er. 

Voe'er astronomers had long before known the moon to be habitable, however upon arrival to their new home the clan of Voe'er found that the atmosphere was much more oxygenated than No'er and had led to the evolution of large beasts that roamed the surface. This drove the group to build a city under the surface, in a large cave system they had found.

After centuries the society lost all contact to the outside worlds and was though to be lost. Around 200 years ago a group of merchants set up a small town and base on the moon where they mined and collected valuable resources from the planets large jungles. Today the moon is known to many as a "exotic-tourist destination" for the wealthy to hunt very dangerous game.

#### Adventure Hook

A small merchant outpost on the moon Riberus in the Yiol system has recently come under attack by a group of mysterious assailants. They have been ransacking large collection and mining machinery, causing a sharp decline in productivity of the settlement. The proprietor of the company, Teo Silver an older Rieandi gentleman, while traveling through the Badar came across your party. He pleaded for you to help him find the cause of the disturbances, offering 50,000 credits if you would return to Riberus and aide him.

## Part 1 - Arrival in Yeo Town

#### The Journey

The travel from Badar to Yiol is a short one, only about 3 days. Your crew may not have been fully acquainted  up to this point. Take this time to introduce each players character and any information they would reasonably share over this journey.

#### The Town

Yeo Town is the merchant settlement that Teo founded on the moon. The whole town is lifted 100 feet above the surface on large metal stilts. The area beneath the town is cleared and functions as the crossroads for all trails and paths created into different parts of the jungle.

Your party stays the night in Teo's home before heading out the next day.

> It might take a bit to get acquainted to the "day" cycle here. On Riberus the days last for about 400 hours since she's tidally locked to the giant. However rest up for now and we will head out to the mining site in 10 hours. That's where we have been seeing the most activity from those beasts.

Take this time to rest, explore the town, shop, or anything else your characters might want/need to do before setting out on the adventure. While the town is small it does have a supplies depot and a tavern for the workers. Essential gear however will be supplied by Teo.
