# Welcome to the Republic of Life

### Republic of Life is a completely custom sci-fi world built for 5e

If you have ever had the need for some fantasy space action in your d&dÂ® campaigns, you have found a completely open-source world designed to scratch that sci-fi itch.

Based in Humanities far future: a collection of alien species have formed a coalition called the Republic of Life, in a densely populated portion of the Milky Way known as *The Sphere*. You can take up the adventurers mantle as an **Adept** (a person with supernatural abilities) or an **Enhanced** (someone who has upgrade themselves cybernetically) from one of the many races living in this futuristic metropolis of stars.
