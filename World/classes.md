# The classes:

The classes are broken into two main categories; the adept and the enhanced. purveyors of both tower over traditional people through either the use of supernatural abilities or the physical improvements of their bodies. 

> Currently the classes are very broad (there are only 5 total), I will be going through and helping to create sub-classes that better define the specialties the classes can lean into. My goal is to keep the classes feeling naturally balanced while allowing you to have lots of freedom in creating your ideal character!

## The Adept

The adept are ones who can channel energy from the world around them to perform a variety of tasks. They are typically sub classed into: the *Congit*(or sensory), and the *Knight* which are defined by their typical manifestation of their abilities. Although there are divisions between these users many of the abilities are not solely purposed for one or another, they are merely the categories that best show the typical cases. 

Adept abilities are cast using the *Dexterity* ability, unless your race has features denoting otherwise.

#### Cognit

> The Cognit are the group of Adept that mainly channel their abilities through their mind. The uses of their abilities is typically considered to be non-martial and works by creating connections between other minds, and enhancing their own. Cognit tend to take on supportive roles where they excel at using these links to provide assistance to allies or access the mind of a target. 
>
> In the improvement of their own minds they are able to take control over the processes inside of their own body entirely and even others. They can mend injuries, provide protection, or even temporarily change their physiology to better adapt to a situation.

#### Knights

> Knights are the group of Adept that are able to channel their abilities through their bodies and are typically defined as being martial in nature. They can project energy out of themselves and use it as a sort of stimulant to increase their own abilities.

Yet further they can use this to create barriers that surround their body, or even conjure physical objects of pure energy.

> In the inner-zones full "cyberization" is seen as taboo, so enhanced will typically limit their physical changes as much as possible. Use this knowledge to create interesting reasons and backstory as to why they made some of these changes. Don't make your character too powerful by having an answer to everything, make sure they have flaws as well.
