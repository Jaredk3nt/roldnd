## The classes:

The classes are broken into two main categories; the adept and the enhanced. purveyors of both tower over traditional people through either the use of supernatural abilities or the physical improvements of their bodies. 

> Currently the classes are very broad (there are only 5 total), I will be going through and helping to create sub-classes that better define the specialties the classes can lean into. My goal is to keep the classes feeling naturally balanced while allowing you to have lots of freedom in creating your ideal character!

#### The Adept

The adept are ones who can channel energy from the world around them to perform a variety of tasks. They are typically sub classed into: the *Congit*(or sensory), and the *Knight* which are defined by their typical manifestation of their abilities. Although there are divisions between these users many of the abilities are not solely purposed for one or another, they are merely the categories that best show the typical cases.

##### Cognit

The Cognit are the group of Adept that mainly channel their abilities through their mind. The uses of their abilities is typically considered to be non-martial and works by creating connections between other minds, and enhancing their own. Cognit tend to take on supportive roles where they excel at using these links to provide assistance to allies or access the mind of a target. 

In the improvement of their own minds they are able to take control over the processes inside of their own body entirely and even others. They can mend injuries, provide protection, or even temporarily change their physiology to better adapt to a situation.

##### Knights

Knights are the group of Adept that are able to channel their abilities through their bodies and are typically defined as being martial in nature. They can project energy out of themselves and use it as a sort of stimulant to increase their own abilities. Knights typically will use this to allow themselves to surpass the limits of their bodies, by adding force to blows, or speed to their stride. Yet further they can use this to create barriers that surround their body, or even conjure physical objects of pure energy.

#### The Enhanced

The enhanced are non-adept who have either used cybernetic enhancements or external tech to thrive. They are typically sub classed into (however taking on many forms due to the ability to mix-and-match so much): The *Bulwark*, the *Striker*, and the *Portent*. 

##### Bulwark

A Bulwark is typically a person who has heavily increased their resilience and strength with massive cybernetic enhancements. Often 50% or more cyber they can fight on the front-lines with brute martial ability. These enhancements often to trade power for dexterity which can often limit what they can do outside of combat.

##### Striker

With mild physical enhancements Strikers tend to fight at range or to an enemies disadvantage. With the widest range of possibilities most Strikers will often have a distinct reason for their specific enhancement.

- Mechanical legs that allow them to run or jump extremely well
- Computer assisted vision that gives them impeccable aim
- Pseudo-invisibility that allows them to strike from the shadows

Many Strikers are already very proficient in their area and chose to get a specific enhancement to further place them ahead of the pack.

> Strikers can take many directions so remember that each character will have a specialty or strength that they play to.

##### Portent

While not solely designed for the battlefield Portents rely on forethought, strategy, and technology to get them through any situation. Typically extremely smart they are masters in their field and are able to support through their abilities.

- Medical training (robotic hands)
- Computer systems or Robotics (cerebral computers or remote connections)
- Vehicles

Portent will have smaller amounts of enhancement that help them to specialize their domain, such as a surgeon with robotic hands or a robotics maker who can remotely control them with their mind.

> In the inner-zones full "cyberization" is seen as taboo, so enhanced will typically limit their physical changes as much as possible. Use this knowledge to create interesting reasons and backstory as to why they made some of these changes. Don't make your character too powerful by having an answer to everything, make sure they have flaws as well.
