# The Republic of Life

This world is based roughly 1000 years into humanity's future. FTL is discovered and allows humans to travel to the stars beyond. In doing so they began to reach the more dense portions of the milky way where despite all odds life was already flourishing . A civilization, made up of many different sentient species, existed in these dense habitable parts of the galaxy known as the **Republic of Life**. Humans joined this coalition of species and struck up a life in this metropolis of stars.

#### Overview

**R.O.L** is an world set in the vast multiverse that is D&DÂ®. The rule set is a modified version of the 5th edition, and all changes to that rule set are to provide proper emersion in a world quite different from the traditional fantasy realms. While the setting is **science** fiction, **R.O.L.** maintains a fantasy world and *often* deviates from science.

#### "Geography"

The **R.O.L.** is made up of 11 systems that exist within a block of space approx. 5 light years (1.54 parsecs) across at its widest berth. The area is colloquially called *The Sphere* by its inhabitants because the over all "sphere-ish" shape of the region. Giving the abundance of "Goldilocks" zone planets (approx. 1 per system) plus quite a few habitable moons, life flourished in the area giving rise to many different species.

#### Governmental systems

*"The Republic of Life"* was established by the Voe'er is a representative form of government that attempts to provide peace and structure to the system of species that live within *The Sphere*. This system of government treats the individual planets or moons as separate entities that are allowed to maintain their own system of laws under the overall guidelines established by the **R.L.**
