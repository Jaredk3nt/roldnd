# The Republic of Life

This world is based roughly 1000 years into humanity's future. FTL is discovered and allows humans to travel to the stars beyond. In doing so they began to reach the more dense portions of the milky way where despite all odds life was already flourishing . A civilization, made up of many different sentient species, existed in these dense habitable parts of the galaxy known as the **Republic of Life**. Humans joined this coalition of species and struck up a life in this metropolis of stars.

> Throughout this guide I have placed some thoughts and notes that break from the world and help you as a player get a better idea of how to place yourself into it. Have fun adventuring!

#### Overview

**R.O.L** is an world set in the vast multiverse that is D&DÂ®. The rule set is a modified version of the 5th edition, and all changes to that rule set are to provide proper emersion in a world quite different from the traditional fantasy realms. While the setting is **science** fiction, **R.O.L.** maintains a fantasy world and *often* deviates from science.

#### "Geography"

The **R.O.L.** is made up of 11 systems that exist within a block of space approx. 5 light years (1.54 parsecs) across at its widest berth. The area is colloquially called *The Sphere* by its inhabitants because the over all "sphere-ish" shape of the region. Giving the abundance of "Goldilocks" zone planets (approx. 1 per system) plus quite a few habitable moons, life flourished in the area giving rise to many different species.

###### Planets

- Sheishe
  - The original home world of the Rieandi people, Sheishe is 90% covered by oceans. While land mass is limited there are tribes of the Rieandi that have taken up on both the solid soil and the glacial poles.
- No'er
  - The birthplace of the **R.O.L** and the Voe'er people. No'er is a large terran planet near the center of *The Sphere* orbiting a white dwarf star. Crystalline structures litter the landscape and mimic the appearance of the race that evolved from its surface.

#### Governmental systems

*"The Republic of Life"* was established by the Voe'er is a representative form of government that attempts to provide peace and structure to the system of species that live within *The Sphere*. This system of government treats the individual planets or moons as separate entities that are allowed to maintain their own system of laws under the overall guidelines established by the **R.L.**

## Common Terms

#### Adeptness

One of the most important concepts is that of the Adept. The Adept are people who are able to access energy from the world around them and use this to enhance or gain abilities (learn more about the range of these abilities in the **classes** section). 

#### *The Sphere*

The colloquial term for the collection of systems that makes up the **Republic of Life's** planets and all parties that exist within them despite their alignment.

## Changes to 5e

The skills in **R.O.L** are slightly modified, the added skills are:

- Vehicle piloting (Dex)
  - How well your character can pilot ships and other vehicles
- Technology (Int) (replaces Arcana)
  - How capable you character is at using and understanding different types of technology

### World Building Tips 

*The Sphere* is a vibrant and diverse place and this can sometimes be hard to describe in such a way that it draws in the players. Here are some tips that can help DM's and contributors accurately describe the world.

###### Setting by race/planet

While there are overviews of what different planets entail, the portions you travel to may not as of yet be described in any detail. When setting up these places make sure to keep the world descriptions in mind, but to remember that worlds are static biomes across the entire surface. You may take your adventurers to the great white north of any planet, or deep within a forest or jungle.

> Life works in the same ways all across the galaxy so using "earth" like examples or descriptions is very okay. The fauna will be different, but will maintain green tones because photosynthesis is just how plants work.
