#### Humans

###### Backstory

One of the newest races to join *The Sphere*, (having only arrived around a century ago) they have flourished in every part of life. From governmental duty, military service, trading & transporting, to more nefarious trades like pirating and black markets humans find their role. 

Only about 3-4% of the human population is considered to be Adept, and even fewer show high level or mastery with the abilities. Thus the adept are treated as highly special, often revered by those around them. Before arriving in *The Sphere* many humans referred to these abilities as magic or witchcraft. However, despite this data shows that more are being born every generation, many believing that living within *The Sphere* has caused this somehow. To this end Humans are typically cybernetically enhanced in some way or another. In fact Humans led the movement towards increased cyberization due to their technology that outmatches most of what the other races have had before their arrival. This increase in technology is due to the long journey the humans had to overcome before reaching *The Sphere*. Humans take great pride in their technological achievements, as this is typically the only thing that keeps the older races respectful of humans.

The human race is typically considered to be split into two main factions, though these lines are not as black & white as many make them out to be. The first is the humans aligning with the galactic governmental system, and the second being those that reject the ideals of the government due to tough relations with some of the other races (read more in the *relations* section). How each individual aligns will heavily affect their backstory, occupation, and alignment. 

###### Alignment

Humans can be found to be in nearly every alignment. Their alignment is usually heavily based upon how they align with the established order of *The Sphere* but typically humans are very *self or clan interested*. Humans are a very social race and will often join into groups based on their beliefs or occupations, they maintain strong loyalties to these clans and will act to protect them at almost any costs. However in situations that can not affect their clan they will tend to act out of strong self-interest and personal gain.

Lawful humans will tend towards good and will hold positions either in government or the military. Humans are very driven and intelligent and can often reach high ranks and show great dutifulness despite the relative barriers towards the younger races taking leadership positions.

###### Culture

Human culture is based on a storied past in terran based life. They hold strong attachment to natural worlds and will often keep mementos of these things while in space. Typically humans love things that come from natural materials or worlds, such as cotton clothing or naturally grown food. Many humans will adorn their residences with plant-life and wool or cotton blankets and rugs when they can afford to.

Humans also greatly enjoy many forms of entertainment and will often go out of their way to have fun or be entertained. 

###### Relations

Humans relations are typically floating in a grey area with most of the other races in *The Sphere*. As one of the younger, shorter lived races, many will distrust their actions or simply stave off connecting with any humans. While they have little past of large-scale violence like some of the other races, the divide in their race makes some of the more lawful races view them all as leaning to rebel against the established order. Humans typically have a harder time climbing to leadership in the government due to these facts. This distrust however has created a cycle for humans as many rebel against the government due to feeling mistreated and not equal to the others.

#### Kol

###### Backstory

The Kol are an older race that has existed deep within *The Sphere* since their species inception. Often cited as the first race to become master Adepts, they consistently produce high-level Adept. Kol hold the Adept abilities is high regard and believe it to be a gift bestowed upon sentient life by *"The Presence"*. *"The Presence"* is how the Kol refer to the universe, as they believe it to be a living being. While the race is heavily based upon connection to *The Presence* and the Adept ability, around 0.5% of the population is considered *"barren"* and are devoid of any ability. Many of these *barren* feel less attached to the belief system of the Kol or even vindictive towards it. Typically the only *enhanced* Kol are from the *barren* as the addition to their bodies is seen as a slight towards the processes that made them.

They hold religious like beliefs in protecting and respecting the universe. While typically neutral and calm-natured Kol are easily provoked when another **blatantly** offends their religious code. However many Kol are expert fighters they tend to avoid military service or participating in any fights within *The Sphere*. They will often aide the R.O.L by acting as mediators or ambassadors in conflicts, often being messengers between factions.

As is part of their upbringing as Adept many Kol go on Missions to spread their ideals and recruit people to join them and train to become stronger Adept.

###### Alignment

Kol are typically neutrally aligned and tend to keep to themselves. They have little care for outsiders of their race except when someone offends them. Many participate and enjoy the way *The Sphere* is governed and take part as representatives and neutral parties in many treaties and other activities. However they don't not feel a strong connection to the "non-natural" code of laws and typically will not go out of their way to right any injustices that do not affect them directly.

###### Culture

Their culture is strongly based upon their belief system in *The Presence*. Kol live very minimalistic lifestyles and don't believe strongly in personal property or ownership. Much of the home world of the Kol is  considered public space, this can often cause misunderstandings with beings of other races. In part of feeling connected to the universe many Kol prize traveling to other parts and experiencing as much as possible. However their race was slow to create many technological advancements due to their reliance on the Adept and simple lifestyles. They did not achieve space travel until they were visited by Voe'er who were in the process of establishing *The Sphere*.

###### Relations

Kol tend to act as a neutral party to all, they have never taken part in any war or large scale fight of any kind. Most consider this due to others fear of their abilities, and the Kol's nature to not take out the actions of one on any others. While their relations are generally good with all of the species residing in *The Sphere*, Kol often act with an air of superiority towards non-Adept's.

###### Physical Traits

With an average life span of 125 - 150 years they are not the longest-living species but are higher than most. Some Adept masters have been said to have increased their life to over 200 years though.

Physically the Kol are humanoid and stand around 6.5ft tall and have longer legs in proportion to their torsos. They tend to have very slender builds with little muscle definition, due to their dependence on the Adept. Their skin is very light and fair with shades ranging from slightly greenish-yellow to light brown. Their hair is very light with very subtle red accents, it is kept long and braided for all people.

#### Neem

###### Backstory

Neemians are a younger race from the furthest planet from the Voe'er's home world. Kept at an arms distance in the **R.O.L** the neemians have tendencies towards violence and conquering. In Neem culture victory is viewed as the ultimate prize at the cost of all other things. This has caused rather strange events in the past of their race as many will leave a side that is seen to be losing a battle. After the Neemian gained FTL travel they started a war over a nearby moon against the Rieandi that was broken up swiftly by the Voe'er, who now keep a watchful eye over their world. Due to the large powers of the Voe'er and the **R.O.L** combined military they have since retreated from conquest, fearing a swift defeat from such a large and advanced army. Many Neem outraged at this show of weakness and "defeat" against the Rieandi, although no end was actually found, have left their home planet for personal conquests of their own. Often becoming pirates or mercenaries in the outlying areas.

They were extremely open to the introduction of cybernetics by the Humans, and have adopted them into their daily lives.

###### Alignment

The Neem are typically chaotic as they often view everything as a contest that needs to be bested. However they exist all over the spectrum from good to evil, often times changing throughout their own lives.

###### Culture

Neem culture is best described through their battle chant "Victory above all".

###### Relations

#### Voe'er

###### Backstory

The original founders of *The Republic of Life*, they are an extremely old race that achieved planetary space travel millennia ago. Their genesis was in one of the central systems, where they began to expand from finding many of the other races and gifting them with the ability to launch to the stars. After uncovering multiple other sentient species they decided to start a large scale republic to provide peace among them. The Voe'er had rocky starts on their home world. Their species was plagued by war in its infancy. This is what drives them to strongly uphold a fair system of laws, to prevent the cycle of death their species had once gone through. They will look for non-violent ends to any conflict in *The Sphere*, like trade embargos, or economic sanctions. However if these methods do not work the Voe'er hold a large council to decide if the use of force is truly required to uphold the peace, and if so will bring fierce power upon the delinquent parties. Large scale military action is considered the true last resort though.

As founders of the government it is typically considered part of a Voe'er's duty to serve it in some form for part of their exceedingly long lives. Those who deny this service are often banished from their ranks and their home worlds sanctums, and labeled disgraces to the goal they have worked towards for thousands of years.

###### Alignment

Voe'er are extremely lawful and typically good or neutral. Their focus on the continuity of the governing system is the guiding moral of most Voe'er.

###### Culture

While outwardly the sole focus of the Voe'er is the maintenance of the government and are often seen as boring and bureaucratic, on their home world they have a strong love of the arts. Much of the Voe'er are practiced at some form of art and it is prominently displayed throughout their planet along with extravagant crystalline architecture. These misconceptions by other races are due to the Voe'er's isolationist policy with regards to their planet. When out on other planets Voe'er will often seek out and collect art from other races. All art is seen as a extremely valuable prize.

###### Relations

Voe'er try to maintain peaceful relationships with all races but will keep races who show deviant tendencies at arms length to attempt to protect their systems. They attempt to solve all problems through diplomacy and compromise.

###### Physical Traits

Voe'er can live to nearly a millennium, with an average around 850 years. However their reproductive cycle is long and children are born sparingly, so their numbers are relatively small compared to the population of *The Sphere* as a whole (only accounting for around around 1 billion).

Physically a Voe'er typically stands around 4ft tall, with a slightly stocky build. While humanoid their skin is made up of a crystalline structure that grows throughout their lifespan. As they age it begins to extrude from them. Many of the oldest Voe'er use adept abilities to levitate as their skin will cause their joints to become stiff and harder to move.

###### Traits & Boosts

**Boosts**: Wisdom +3

**The old ones**:  You have advantage on *Wisdom* checks

**Crystalline hide**: Enemies have *disadvantage* when attacking you with *melee* weapons

#### Rieandi

###### Backstory

Hailing from a planet with almost no land masses the Rieandi have evolved to live on and around the water.  The Rieandi are not entirely aquatic but more amphibious as they can spend alot of time in the water, but choose to live and build ontop of the water. 

The species had divided itself into kingdoms that spanned large parts of the globe.  Each of the clans holds great honor in their kingdoms and are loyal to the royalty that rule them. 

While their technology is highly specialized to their oceanic needs and they had not discovered space travel, after being gifted it by the Voe'er they became a highly mercantile people. The base of the oceans hold vast mineral riches that sell for extremely high prices on other worlds. As large amounts of wealth pour into the world the Kingdoms have become even more powerful.

Highly mercantile many Rieandi travel around to peddle wares and resources. However on the planet they take part in the economy and traditions of their kingdoms. Most work soley for the benefit of their respective royal families.

The Rieandi have a tendency towards partying and celebration. The kingdoms have long enstated many holidays and tradition based celebrations to boost the moral and support of their people. You can often find them in bars and taverns across the stars.

###### Relations

The Rieandi get along well with basically all other races due to their mercantile trade. They are very common in all parts of *The Sphere* and have pioneered most of the popular trade routes between the planets.
