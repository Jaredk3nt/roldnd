# Rules & Guidelines

Not everything from 5e fits perfectly into a science-fiction world. In order not to break immersion and to attempt to have a more fluid and fitting gameplay we have tweaking 5e slightly.

### Introduction of *Inter and intra-planetary travel*

One of the largest barriers to cross is defining how traveling between worlds will work, as this is something that can only partially be related to how a fantasy world work. Distances in a "galactic" setting become much different and have to be treated differently in kind. Short distances will remain the same, walking through cities, treks through uninhabited areas, etc. However when traveling on a global scale Many new vehicle options must be introduced.

###### Intra-planetary travel

When writing campaigns in this world you need to keep in mind the planet and the civilization that inhabits that planet in deciding how the party will travel. 

- Jets/Planes
  - For traveling great distances across many planets, flight will be required to make these journeys possible. Planes can either be chartered privately by the quest-giver or taken by the players by purchasing tickets at airports. Prices will be determined by distances and the planet and culture itself. (On a planet like <u>Sheishe</u> you may have to pay more or go out of your way since there is little land and therefore fewer airstrips)
  - Planes in **R.O.L** have a movement speed of 1000 miles per hour
- Bullet trains/Hyper-Loops
  - Within regions or small continents there may be high-speed trains available for transport. This will always be by ticket, whether the party purchases themselves, or they are given by an NPC.
  - These trains will have a movement speed of 500 miles per hour
- Autos
  - In regions, cities, or other smaller areas traveling by Auto may be the best choice. Autos are automated self-driving vehicles that can be requested via terminals in many areas.
  - Autos will travel at 100 miles per hour

Keep all of these options and more in mind when you are adventuring.

###### Inter-planetary travel

The big leap is to planet-to-planet travel. In this world FTL travel has existed for quite some time and is very sophisticated and safe. However it is not a blink, the furthest distances you will most likely travel within *The Sphere* will still take your party a week or more of travel time (while shorter distances, which will be more typical, will likely be a couple of days). For this reason it is usually suggested to limit space travel to a relative minimum. This mainly means jumping planets should hold great significance to the plot of the adventure.

> Having encounters or portions of your campaign take place on-board a inter-planetary vessel can be an interesting way to adventure. Keep an open mind while writing new campaigns!

To take an interplanetary vessel your party must make their way to a *Waypoint* (A large shipyard and dock for space ships of all manner). On larger planets there maybe 2-3 but typically there is only one, located in the largest city on the planet. From here you may charter a ticket onto a civilian class ship which will carry a couple hundred people from one planet to another, or you can make use of smaller private ships.

Private ships are extremely costly, so it is quite a pipe-dream for adventurers such as yourselves having one for your party. However a rich financer, government contract, or other such adventure may call for your party obtaining one of these vessels. If you do manage to get a private vessel it is suggested that you have a party member proficient in *Vehicle piloting* to make rolls for you on your journey, lest misfortune befall your crew.  Common Shipping lanes tend to be rather clear of all manner of miscreants, especially near highly populous planets in the center of *The Sphere*. However, as your adventures may draw you into more empty space, or less traveled sectors you may come across some trouble as you fly. Your pilot should be proficient in flight, but the rest of the party may have to man the guns to take on enemies. Using dexterity checks you will treat battle in space similarly to that on the ground. 

> In each campaign the writer or DM will come up with the stats and number of guns aboard your ship, and those on the enemies as well.

While the main shipping lanes *tend* to be safer, trouble will come to civilian class ships as well! Each campaign will have tables for you to refer to what the party may run into on certain travels, and in specific parts of space.

### Currency - *The Infamous Credit*

Like every good sci-fi world, the material presence of high-priced metals is now heavily out-weighed by a massive population. Gold, Silver, and Bronze pieces don't quite make sense in this world so we will introduce the classic; **Credit**. In its establishment **R.O.L** made a standard currency for all worlds and people living within it.

> Think of a single credit as a *Bronze* piece. One alone isn't worth much, so you will probably have quite a bit on your person at all times.

While staying in the inner-zones of *The Sphere* your credits will always be good. However when dealing with bandits and rebels you may have to barter and trade them for goods & services. So it might be a good idea to have some stuff on you for this purpose when heading into more *chaotic* territory.

### Changes to combatÂ 

In ROL I have made some changes to how combat works in an effort to make it more interactive and "feel" better for the players.

> These changes are based on my personal views on how 5e plays, and are not a requirement for playing ROL! Whatever makes the game most fun to your party is the right way to play.

##### Melee Combat

When fighting someone up close, your attacks are not the only thing happening, the enemy is actively fighting back and vice versa. To better illustrate this interaction Fighting now takes place with checks from both parties in an attack. This fighting system removes the 5e idea of AC and replaces it with a back and forth between the characters.

**First** the attacker makes a roll with a d20 for "control" of the action. This roll gives you a modifier on the next actual attacking roll. The modifier is based on this table:

| 1      | 2-3  | 4-6  | 7-9  | 10-12 | 13-16 | 17-19 | 20   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| *miss* | -2   | -1   | +0   | +1    | +2    | +3    | hit  |

**Second** both attacker and defender make a roll. The attacker rolls a d20 + the attack style modifier (dexterity or strength) and the "control" value from the first step. Then the defender makes a check with a d20 + defending style (can be dexterity or constitution) and any bonuses their armor may give. 

If the attackers roll is higher they deal damage to the target as usual, below the defenders roll and the damage falls off at a steep rate. 1 below and the target takes half damage, 2 below and the target takes a fourth of the damage. In the case of equal rolls + the modifiers, the attack is said to be a "parry" and both parties roll again.

##### Ranged Combat

Ranged combat is much more about the individual skill of the attacker, rather than the defensive capabilities of the attacked. However it shouldn't be completely non-interactive for the defender, so ranged attack will work on a modified system similar to traditional 5e spells and saves.

The ranged attacker makes a dexterity roll with a d20 for the "hit". If the roll is below 10 the attack misses, if the roll is between 10 - 14 the attack hits, but the target has the opportunity to make a dexterity or constitution saving throw to take half damage (must be higher than the roll the attacker made), a roll of 15-19 is a true hit and the target takes normal damage with no chance of a saving throw, and a 20 or above is a critical hit.

> I intend to thoroughly play test this change to combat and make any balancing changes necessary to it, the weapons, classes, or armor.
