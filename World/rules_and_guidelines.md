# Rules & Guidelines

Not everything from 5e fits perfectly into a science-fiction world. In order not to break immersion and to attempt to have a more fluid and fitting gameplay we have tweaking 5e slightly.

### Introduction of *Inter and intra-planetary travel*

One of the largest barriers to cross is defining how traveling between worlds will work, as this is something that can only partially be related to how a fantasy world work. Distances in a "galactic" setting become much different and have to be treated differently in kind. Short distances will remain the same, walking through cities, treks through uninhabited areas, etc. However when traveling on a global scale Many new vehicle options must be introduced.

###### Intra-planetary travel

When writing campaigns in this world you need to keep in mind the planet and the civilization that inhabits that planet in deciding how the party will travel. 

- Jets/Planes
  - For traveling great distances across many planets, flight will be required to make these journeys possible. Planes can either be chartered privately by the quest-giver or taken by the players by purchasing tickets at airports. Prices will be determined by distances and the planet and culture itself. (On a planet like <u>Sheishe</u> you may have to pay more or go out of your way since there is little land and therefore fewer airstrips)
  - Planes in **R.O.L** have a movement speed of 1000 miles per hour
- Bullet trains/Hyper-Loops
  - Within regions or small continents there may be high-speed trains available for transport. This will always be by ticket, whether the party purchases themselves, or they are given by an NPC.
  - These trains will have a movement speed of 500 miles per hour
- Autos
  - In regions, cities, or other smaller areas traveling by Auto may be the best choice. Autos are automated self-driving vehicles that can be requested via terminals in many areas.
  - Autos will travel at 100 miles per hour

Keep all of these options and more in mind when you are adventuring.

###### Inter-planetary travel

The big leap is to planet-to-planet travel. In this world FTL travel has existed for quite some time and is very sophisticated and safe. However it is not a blink, the furthest distances you will most likely travel within *The Sphere* will still take your party a week or more of travel time. For this reason it is usually suggested to limit space travel to a relative minimum. This mainly means jumping planets should hold great significance to the plot of the adventure.

> Having encounters or portions of your campaign take place on-board a inter-planetary vessel can be an interesting way to adventure. Keep an open mind while writing new campaigns!
