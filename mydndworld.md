# The Republic of Life

This world is based roughly 1000 years into humanity's future. FTL is discovered and allows humans to travel to the stars beyond. In doing so they began to reach the more dense portions of the milky way where despite all odds life was already flourishing . A civilization, made up of many different sentient species, existed in these dense habitable parts of the galaxy known as the **Republic of Life**. Humans joined this coalition of species and struck up a life in this metropolis of stars.

#### Governmental systems

*"The Republic of Life"* was established by the Voe'er is a representative form of government that attempts to provide peace and structure to the system of species that live within *The Sphere*. This system of government treats the individual planets or moons as separate entities that are allowed to maintain their own system of laws under the overall guidelines established by the **R.L.**

## Common Terms

#### Adeptness

One of the most important concepts is that of the Adept. The Adept are people who are able to access energy from the world around them and use this to enhance or gain abilities (learn more about the range of these abilities in the **classes** section). 

#### *The Sphere*

The colloquial term for the collection of systems that makes up the **Republic of Life's** planets and all parties that exist within them despite their alignment.

## The races:

The galaxy is full of vibrant sentient species that come each with a rich tapestry of history and characteristics. Choosing your race will help you define how you act, how you align, and the roles you can participate in.

Mold breaking is highly encouraged and can give very interesting back story to your characters that drive them to surpass the typicality's of their race.

#### Humans

###### Backstory

One of the newest races to join *The Sphere*, they have flourished in every part of life. From governmental duty, military service, trading & transporting, to more nefarious trades like pirating and black markets humans find their role. 

Only about 3-4% of the human population is considered to be Adept, and even fewer show high level or mastery with the abilities. However, despite this data shows that more are being born every generation. To this end Humans are typically cybernetically enhanced in some way or another. In fact Humans led the movement towards increased cyberization due to their technology that outmatches most of what the other races have had before their arrival. This increase in technology is due to the long journey the humans had to overcome before reaching *The Sphere*. Humans take great pride in their technological achievements, as this is typically the only thing that keeps the older races respectful of humans.

The human race is typically considered to be split into two main factions, though these lines are not as black & white as many make them out to be. The first is the humans aligning with the galactic governmental system, and the second being those that reject the ideals of the government due to tough relations with some of the other races (read more in the *relations* section). How each individual aligns will heavily affect their backstory, occupation, and alignment. 

###### Alignment

Humans can be found to be in nearly every alignment. Their alignment is usually heavily based upon how they align with the established order of *The Sphere* but typically humans are very *self or clan interested*. Humans are a very social race and will often join into groups based on their beliefs or occupations, they maintain strong loyalties to these clans and will act to protect them at almost any costs. However in situations that can not affect their clan they will tend to act out of strong self-interest and personal gain.

Lawful humans will tend towards good and will hold positions either in government or the military. Humans are very driven and intelligent and can often reach high ranks and show great dutifulness despite the relative barriers towards the younger races taking leadership positions.

###### Culture

Human culture is based on a storied past in terran based life. They hold strong attachment to natural worlds and will often keep mementos of these things while in space. Typically humans love things that come from natural materials or worlds, such as cotton clothing or naturally grown food. Many humans will adorn their residences with plant-life and wool or cotton blankets and rugs when they can afford to.

Humans also greatly enjoy many forms of entertainment and will often go out of their way to have fun or be entertained. 

###### Relations

Humans relations are typically floating in a grey area with most of the other races in *The Sphere*. As one of the younger, shorter lived races, many will distrust their actions or simply stave off connecting with any humans. While they have little past of large-scale violence like some of the other races, the divide in their race makes some of the more lawful races view them all as leaning to rebel against the established order. Humans typically have a harder time climbing to leadership in the government due to these facts. This distrust however has created a cycle for humans as many rebel against the government due to feeling mistreated and not equal to the others.

#### Kol

> ( the o is pronounced at the back of the throat)

###### Backstory

The Kol are an older race that has existed deep within *The Sphere* since their species inception. Often cited as the first race to become master Adepts, they consistently produce high-level Adept. Kol hold the Adept abilities is high regard and believe it to be a gift bestowed upon sentient life by *"The Presence"*. *"The Presence"* is how the Kol refer to the universe, as they believe it to be a living being. While the race is heavily based upon connection to *The Presence* and the Adept ability, around 0.5% of the population is considered *"barren"* and are devoid of any ability. Many of these *barren* feel less attached to the belief system of the Kol or even vindictive towards it. Typically the only *enhanced* Kol are from the *barren* as the addition to their bodies is seen as a slight towards the processes that made them.

They hold religious like beliefs in protecting and respecting the universe. While typically neutral and calm-natured Kol are easily provoked when another **blatantly** offends their religious code. This is dangerous as the high level of Adept ability of a Kol can prove devastating to an offender. Most other races choose to stray away from offending a Kol.

###### Alignment

Kol are typically neutrally aligned and tend to keep to themselves. They have little care for outsiders of their race except when someone offends them. Many participate and enjoy the way *The Sphere* is governed and take part as representatives and neutral parties in many treaties and other activities. However they don't not feel a strong connection to the "non-natural" code of laws and typically will not go out of their way to right any injustices that do not affect them directly.

###### Culture

Their culture is strongly based upon their belief system in *The Presence*. Kol live very minimalistic lifestyles and don't believe strongly in personal property or ownership. Much of the home world of the Kol is  considered public space, this can often cause misunderstandings with beings of other races. In part of feeling connected to the universe many Kol prize traveling to other parts and experiencing as much as possible. However their race was slow to create many technological advancements due to their reliance on the Adept and simple lifestyles. They did not achieve space travel until they were visited by Voe'er who were in the process of establishing *The Sphere*.

###### Relations

Kol tend to act as a neutral party to all, they have never taken part in any war or large scale fight of any kind. Most consider this due to others fear of their abilities, and the Kol's nature to not take out the actions of one on any others. While their relations are generally good with all of the species residing in *The Sphere*, Kol often act with an air of superiority towards non-Adept's.

###### Physical Traits

With an average life span of 125 - 150 years they are not the longest-living species but are higher than most. Some Adept masters have been said to have increased their life to over 200 years though.

Physically the Kol are humanoid and stand around 6.5ft tall and have longer legs in proportion to their torsos. They tend to have very slender builds with little muscle definition, due to their dependence on the Adept. Their skin is very light and fair with shades ranging from slightly greenish-yellow to light brown. Their hair is very light with very subtle red accents, it is kept long and braided for all people.

###### Physical Traits

> old

A race only slightly older than humans they ride the fringe in the inner-zone. They have tendencies towards violence and conquering for glory that rivals humans typical self-interest. While not necessarily evil their actions will often be chaotic or reckless. Neemians are the race that is most into enchantments. No neemian has ever been found to be adept to current knowledge. Due to their temperament they rely on heavier enhancements for fighting. While neemians will clan up similarly to humans they tend to be slightly less loyal and will often change sides to be with the Victor. Many of the other races coin them with the phrase "victory above honor or pride".
Neemian are humanoid with light blue or purlple tints to their skin. They stand at an average of 5ft tall so slightly shorter than humans but with roughly the same build. Their strength is typically only slightly higher than that of a comparable human without enhancements.



#### Voe'er

###### Backstory

The original founders of *The Republic of Life*, they are an extremely old race that achieved planetary space travel millennia ago. Their genesis was in one of the central systems, where they began to expand from finding many of the other races and gifting them with the ability to launch to the stars. After uncovering multiple other sentient species they decided to start a large scale republic to provide peace among them. The Voe'er had rocky starts on their home world. Their species was plagued by war in its infancy. This is what drives them to strongly uphold a fair system of laws, to prevent the cycle of death their species had once gone through. As founders of the government it is typically considered part of a Voe'er's duty to serve it in some form for part of their exceedingly long lives. Those who deny this service are often banished from their ranks and their home worlds sanctums, and labeled disgraces to the goal they have worked towards for thousands of years.

###### Alignment

Voe'er are extremely lawful and typically good or neutral. Their focus on the continuity of the governing system is the guiding moral of most Voe'er.

###### Culture

While outwardly the sole focus of the Voe'er is the maintenance of the government and are often seen as boring and bureaucratic, on their home world they have a strong love of the arts. Much of the Voe'er are practiced at some form of art and it is prominently displayed throughout their planet along with extravagant crystalline architecture. These misconceptions by other races are due to the Voe'er's isolationist policy with regards to their planet. When out on other planets Voe'er will often seek out and collect art from other races. All art is seen as a extremely valuable prize.

###### Relations

Voe'er try to maintain peaceful relationships with all races but will keep races who show deviant tendencies at arms length to attempt to protect their systems. They attempt to solve all problems through diplomacy and compromise.

###### Physical Traits

Voe'er can live to nearly a millennium, with an average around 850 years. However their reproductive cycle is long and children are born sparingly, so their numbers are relatively small compared to the population of *The Sphere* as a whole (only accounting for around around 1 billion).

Physically a Voe'er typically stands around 4ft tall, with a slightly stocky build. While humanoid their skin is made up of a crystalline structure that grows throughout their lifespan. As they age it begins to extrude from them. Many of the oldest Voe'er use adept abilities to levitate as their skin will cause their joints to become stiff and harder to move.

## The classes:

The classes are broken into two main categories; the adept and the enhanced. purveyors of both tower over traditional people through either the use of supernatural abilities or the physical improvements of their bodies. 

> Currently the classes are very broad (there are only 5 total), I will be going through and helping to create sub-classes that better define the specialties the classes can lean into. My goal is to keep the classes feeling naturally balanced while allowing you to have lots of freedom in creating your ideal character!

#### The Adept

The adept are ones who can channel energy from the world around them to perform a variety of tasks. They are typically sub classed into: the *Congit*(or sensory), and the *Knight* which are defined by their typical manifestation of their abilities. Although there are divisions between these users many of the abilities are not solely purposed for one or another, they are merely the categories that best show the typical cases.

##### Cognit

The Cognit are the group of Adept that mainly channel their abilities through their mind. The uses of their abilities is typically considered to be non-martial and works by creating connections between other minds, and enhancing their own. Cognit tend to take on supportive roles where they excel at using these links to provide assistance to allies or access the mind of a target. 

In the improvement of their own minds they are able to take control over the processes inside of their own body entirely and even others. They can mend injuries, provide protection, or even temporarily change their physiology to better adapt to a situation.

##### Knights

Knights are the group of Adept that are able to channel their abilities through their bodies and are typically defined as being martial in nature. They can project energy out of themselves and use it as a sort of stimulant to increase their own abilities. Knights typically will use this to allow themselves to surpass the limits of their bodies, by adding force to blows, or speed to their stride. Yet further they can use this to create barriers that surround their body, or even conjure physical objects of pure energy.

---

#### The Enhanced

The enhanced are non-adept who have either used cybernetic enhancements or external tech to thrive. They are typically sub classed into (however taking on many forms due to the ability to mix-and-match so much): The *Bulwark*, the *Striker*, and the *Portent*. 

##### Bulwark

A Bulwark is typically a person who has heavily increased their resilience and strength with massive cybernetic enhancements. Often 50% or more cyber they can fight on the front-lines with brute martial ability. These enhancements often to trade power for dexterity which can often limit what they can do outside of combat.

##### Striker

With mild physical enhancements Strikers tend to fight at range or to an enemies disadvantage. With the widest range of possibilities most Strikers will often have a distinct reason for their specific enhancement.

- Mechanical legs that allow them to run or jump extremely well
- Computer assisted vision that gives them impeccable aim
- Pseudo-invisibility that allows them to strike from the shadows

Many Strikers are already very proficient in their area and chose to get a specific enhancement to further place them ahead of the pack.

> Strikers can take many directions so remember that each character will have a specialty or strength that they play to.

##### Portent

While not solely designed for the battlefield Portents rely on forethought, strategy, and technology to get them through any situation. Typically extremely smart they are masters in their field and are able to support through their abilities.

- Medical training (robotic hands)
- Computer systems or Robotics (cerebral computers or remote connections)
- Vehicles

Portent will have smaller amounts of enhancement that help them to specialize their domain, such as a surgeon with robotic hands or a robotics maker who can remotely control them with their mind.

> In the inner-zones full "cyberization" is seen as taboo, so enhanced will typically limit their physical changes as much as possible. Use this knowledge to create interesting reasons and backstory as to why they made some of these changes. Don't make your character too powerful by having an answer to everything, make sure they have flaws as well.
